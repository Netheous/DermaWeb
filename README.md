# DermaWeb
An experiment/attempt on recreating GMod's Derma and create somewhat similar to Lua framework.

There are 2 files with examples on how to use it - you can either use pure HTML or JavaScript to create elements.
The 'framework' was written to imitate Lua and how it handles Derma elements.

This is as close as I could reproduce it:
